Base classes for v3dfx with unified backend support for eglimage and imgstream. Refactoring work in progress.


REQUIREMENTS:
- Graphics SDK later than 4.08.xx.xx
- Platform that supports a method to allocate contiguous bufferrs (preferably but not required in eglimage case)

BUILD STEPS:

Building is a 2 step process - First build the api library (static .a) and then build the test applications.

Refer to the individual makefiles for build documentation

EXECUTION STEPS:
Boot steps - allow for CMEM
setenv bootargs 'console=ttyO0,115200n8 mem=99M@0x80000000 mem=103M@0x89900000 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootfstype=ext3 rootdelay=1 init=/init ip=dhcp vram=8M omapfb.vram=0:8M'
mmc init;fatload mmc 0 82000000 uImage;bootm 0x82000000

Assuming filesystem with Graphics SDK installed, and with v3dfx-base-test.

> insmod cmemk.ko allowOverlap=1 phys_start=0x86300000 phys_end=0x871fffff pools=16x1500,2x2048,2x5120,18x16384,1x110000,8x131072,1x150000,2x1048576,4x1843200,1x3670016

For imgstream only
> insmod bufferclass_ti.ko

> cd v3dfx-base/test/eglimage or v3dfx-base/test/imgstream
> ./v3fdx-base-test-eglimage or ./v3dfx-base-test-imgstream

For test8:
This should produce a plain colour matching the colour set in test8_init_texture_streaming_userptr. In the current tag, it should be green (0 in YUV)

For test20 with v3dfx-base: Should produce a changing colour pattern

Feb 2012:
- Code added for exposing an uniform API for different backends. Added tests.
- Validated with older test8 from sgxperf to check flow
- Todo validation of eglimage and imgstream

Feb 2012:
- Validated imgstream
- Created Qt template

June 2013:
- Validated with eglImage on Graphics SDK 4.08* and with AM335x EVM-SK
